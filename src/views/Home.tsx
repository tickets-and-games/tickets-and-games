          We are lot of 4th year CS majors from NJIT, with ambitions like these to
          create even more PC games (not that we play enough). This keeps us busy and engaged
          as we develop, but also as we play our works of art
          (our definition might differ from yours *cough cough*).
          The opportunity to learn more about our trade through such projects and see/interact
          with our outcome is a gratifying experience for all of us. We hope to bring
          these newfound skills and apply them to our work going forward!
