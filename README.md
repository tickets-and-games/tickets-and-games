## Running for Development

First, create `.env` file with all the required environment variables.

Then you have to have the server running
```bash
python -m flask db upgrade
python app.py
```

Change the proxy port in packages.json to  the port you're using for the server.
Then,  in a separate shell, run the client
```bash
npm run start
```

Then, go to http://localhost:3000
All the api calls should be automatically proxied to the flask server.

## Running on Production

If you, for whatever reason, want to run the server on production without something like heroku, you first have to build the client by
```bash
npm run build
```

and then start the server by
```bash
python app.py
```

The server will automatically serve the client files from the build directory.
